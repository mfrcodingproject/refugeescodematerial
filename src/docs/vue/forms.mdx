## Introduction

Form is used to collect, validate, and submit the user input, usually contains various form items including checkbox, radio, input, select, etc.. Learning to work with forms properly in our favorite frameworks is valuable, and it can save us some time and energy during development. Vue provides some tools that allow the developers to manage user data easily.
