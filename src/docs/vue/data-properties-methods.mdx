title: 'Data properties and methods'
description: Data properties and methods | Vue | RefugeesCode

## Introduction

In previous modules, we have already seen an introduction to how data works in Vue components. **Data** is a special property of Vue that does not exist in JavaScript, If it rings a bell, it could remind you of the variables that we learned in the JavaScript module but much more powerful!

We will also learn about Vue **methods**. We have already seen methods (or functions) in previous modules.

In both cases, Vue will help us bring these features a step further. If you thought that variables and functions are powerful, you'll see that you can do amazing things using Vue!

## Goals

- [ ]  Learn how to bind data to the Vue template
- [ ]  Learn how to call to functions from other parts of your component

## Basic tools

In this module, we will learn how Vue manages data. In previous modules, we learned how to manage data in JavaScript. Since both are quite similar, this module will be really easy if you review these lessons:

- JavaScript variables: [https://refugees-code-material.netlify.app/basic-js/contents#variables](https://refugees-code-material.netlify.app/basic-js/contents#variables)
- Functions: [https://refugees-code-material.netlify.app/advanced-js/functions](https://refugees-code-material.netlify.app/advanced-js/functions)

### The data property

Data is a function in Vue that returns an object. This object is the data you can use in your component, including your template, and it's reactive. Reactive means that if this data changes (for instance, as a result of a user event) it changes everywhere.

- Read this example using the data property: [https://reactgo.com/intro-methods-and-data-property-vuejs/#data-property](https://reactgo.com/intro-methods-and-data-property-vuejs/#data-property)
- Read the Vue documentation about the data property: [https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/data-methods.html#data-properties](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/data-methods.html#data-properties)

### Methods

`Method` is another name for `function`. In VueJS you can create methods and call them from the anywhere in the component, including the template.
