## Introduction

We have already learned how JavaScript, HTML and CSS work. That means that you are able to create complex and advanced applications using the main frontend languages

Said that, the complexity of the websites has evolved rapidly in the past years. At this moment, most of the web development requires great amounts of code to offer advanced products with an extraordinary user experience. Doing it requires a massive amount of time and effort.

That's when frameworks came in. A framework is a tool developed in JavaScript that simplifies some of the most complex and repetitive tasks of the web development. Let's say creating a new element on the DOM and adding some text will require to create the element, create the text, then add the text to the new node and finally insert this node into the DOM. Using a framework that would cost 1 line of code.

Interesting, isn't it? During this course, you'll learn about VueJS, one of the main JS frameworks.

## Goals

- [ ]  Learn and understand what are JavaScript frameworks
- [ ]  Learn what are the more common frameworks
- [ ]  Learn how to install VueJS
- [ ]  Learn the basics of VueJS

## Basic tools

Since probably is the first time you learn about JavaScript frameworks, it's better to have a basic understanding about them and why you should use them. Read this introductory article: I[ntroduction to client-side frameworks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Introduction)

As you've seen, there are many frameworks to choose. In fact, there are plenty of them. The most common frameworks at this moment are React, Angular and VueJS. Learn a bit about them reading this article: [React vs Angular vs Vue.js — What to choose in 2020?](https://medium.com/techmagic/reactjs-vs-angular5-vs-vue-js-what-to-choose-in-2018-b91e028fa91d)

So why did we choose VueJS? We think that is the easiest to start with. Once you learned VueJS, you'll learn any other framework blazing fast. And don't worry, VueJS is as powerful as any other framework out there.

We will be following VueJS official documentation because is the best resource to learn about this framework. Bookmark it in your browser because you'll probably coming back to this page quite often: [https://v3.vuejs.org](https://v3.vuejs.org/)

### Introduction to VueJS

Vue is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Its core part is focused mainly on the view layer, and it is very easy to understand.

- 📽️ Why VueJS?: [https://player.vimeo.com/video/455611549?dnt=1](https://player.vimeo.com/video/455611549?dnt=1)
- Read this article from FreeCodeCamp until the section `Your first Vue App`: [](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/#common-html-terms)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-vue-handbook-a-thorough-introduction-to-vue-js-1e86835d8/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-vue-handbook-a-thorough-introduction-to-vue-js-1e86835d8446/)

Can you explain what is a framework? Which are the most popular frameworks? Why did we choose VueJS?

### Declarative rendering

At the core of Vue.js is a system that enables us to render data to the DOM using straightforward template syntax.

- 📽️ Watch this introduction to a basic Vue app: [https://scrimba.com/scrim/cQ3QVcr?pl=pXKqta](https://scrimba.com/scrim/cQ3QVcr?pl=pXKqta)

Congratulations!! We have already created our very first Vue app! This looks pretty similar to rendering elements using JavaScript, but Vue has done it a lot easier.

If you want to learn more about this, read the full article in Vue documentation [https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#declarative-rendering](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#declarative-rendering)

### Advanced Javascript and VueJS

Most of the advanced features you have learned recently are available in Vue in a simplified and efficient way. So instead of writing tons of lines to insert elements in DOM you can rely on this framework. See this examples (we'll learn more about this soon!)

- Events: [https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#handling-user-input](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#handling-user-input)
- Conditionals and loops: [https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#conditionals-and-loops](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#conditionals-and-loops)

### Components

Components are pieces of code that can be reused many times around you app. Using a component framework, as this one, it is quite easy to reuse parts of your HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The component system is an important concept in Vue, because it's an abstraction that allows us to build large-scale applications composed of small, self-contained, and often reusable components.

- 📽️ Watch this video that introduces the idea of reusable components. Don't pay too much attention to the component itself, but to how can some piece of HTML can be reused and how to create custom tags: [https://vueschool.io/lessons/introduction-to-components](https://vueschool.io/lessons/introduction-to-components)

### Install VueJS

**Warning!** This section requires you to have installed *nodeJS* and *npm* in your system. If you did not install yet this tools, you'll not be able to work with most of the developer ecosystem libraries and frameworks. We strongly recommend asking your teacher before getting into this. Otherwise, follow this article: [Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#overview)

Seems interesting, isn't it? Why don't we try to use it? Follow this exercise and install VueJS in your computer.
