## Introduction

Templates often need complex data. As an example, imagine we are developing a movie list app. In the movie list, we may get the data of a movie opening from an API, but we need to display how old is the movie in our template. To get that data, we need a mathematical operation.

Another example, imagine we have a list of students and the API give us the marks of their tests, but we need to display their average mark. This will require summing and dividing all marks.

Computed and watched properties is the way Vue has to do these operations and display the result in a template.

## Goals

- [ ]  Learn how to combine reactive data to get new data
- [ ]  Learn the difference between current and asynchronous operations

## Basic tools

To understand correctly this lesson, you'll need to review two things from the previous material: methods and API calls.

In case of doubt, read this short explanation of the difference between synchronous and asynchronous [https://rowanmanning.com/posts/javascript-for-beginners-async/](https://rowanmanning.com/posts/javascript-for-beginners-async/)

## Contents

### Computed

Read the introduction to computed properties in the Vue documentation, and please pay attention to the examples. Is self-explanatory: [https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/computed.html#computed-properties](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/computed.html#computed-properties)

### Watchers

This feature is quite similar to the previous one. Read the article on the Vue documentation  [https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/computed.html#watchers](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/computed.html#watchers)

### Computed vs Watcher property

Did you spot the difference?

What's the difference between a computed property and a method? Read this section of the Vue docs to understand its narrow difference. [https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/computed.html#computed-caching-vs-methods](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/computed.html#computed-caching-vs-methods)
