# REACT ROUTER
## Introduction

`react-router-dom` also called react router, is a third-party library used in web applications built with React. It provides a robust solution for handling routing in your applications.

 
**Routing** is the ability to move between different parts of an application when a user enters a URL or clicks an element (like a link) within the application.

 
Since React is Single Page Application we will need to render different components depending on the current route to simulate the navigation.

## Goals


-  [ ] Understand React routing
-  [ ] Route your React components
-  [ ] Create a navigation bar

## Basic tools

[React router documentation - Adding a router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial#adding-a-router)

## Contents
### Declarative Routing:


When the URL matches a certain pattern, the corresponding component is rendered. Let's say you have a website with a Home page, About page and Contact page. In declarative routing, you would set up rules like this:

  
* If the URL is `/`, show the Home page.
* If the URL is `/about`, show the About page.
* If the URL is `/contact`, show the Contact page.


In code, using `react-router-dom`, it would look something like this:

```jsx

import { BrowserRouter  as  Router, Route } from  "react-router-dom";
import  Home  from  "./components/Home";
import  About  from  "./components/About";
import  Contact  from  "./components/Contact"

//...other imports here


function  App() {
  return (
  <Router>
    <Route  path="/"  exact  component={Home}  />
    <Route  path="/about"  component={About}  />
    <Route  path="/contact"  component={Contact}  />
  </Router>
);

}

```

In this code, `Home`, `About`, and `Contact` are React components that render the content for each page. The `path` prop in the `Route` component is the URL that **will trigger the component to be shown**. When the URL in the browser matches the path, the corresponding component is displayed. This is declarative routing.


### Dynamic Routing

It is the ability to define routes that can change based on the application state or user interaction. Let's say you have a blog website where users can click on a blog post to read it. Each blog post has its own unique URL, like `/post/1`, `/post/2`, etc. The number after `/post/` is the ID of the blog post.

Instead of defining a route for each blog post manually, as above, you can define a dynamic route that can handle all blog posts:

```jsx

<Route  path="/post/:id"  component={BlogPost}  />

``` 

### Route Parameters


It allows you to capture <b>dynamic parts of the URL</b> as parameters, which can be used to dynamically load data based on the route. If you define the following route:


```jsx

<Route  path="/post/:id"  component={BlogPost}  />

```

In this route, `:id` is a placeholder for the ID of the blog post. When a user goes to a URL like `/post/1`, the `BlogPost` component is shown, and it can access the ID (`1` in this case) from the route parameters to load the correct blog post.


```jsx

function  BlogPost({ match }) {
  const  postId = match.params.id;
// Now you can use postId to load the correct book from DB4
}

```


### Navigation

`react-router-dom` provides `<Link/>` and `<Redirect/>` components.


`<Link/>`: This component is used to create links in your application. It's similar to using an `<a>` tag in HTML, but it has the advantage of not causing a full page refresh when the link is clicked. Instead, it updates the URL and renders the new component without refreshing the page. Here's an example:

  

```jsx

import { Link } from  "react-router-dom";

function  NavBar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link  to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link  to="/about">About</Link>
      <Link  to="/contact">Contact</Link>
    </nav>
  );
}

export  default  NavBar;

```

In this example, clicking on `Home`, `About`, or `Contact` will change the URL to `/`, `/about`, or `/contact` respectively

`<Redirect>`: This component is used to automatically redirect from one route to another. It's useful when you want to redirect the user based on some condition. For example, if a user tries to access a page they're not authorized to see, you can redirect them to a login page. Here's an example:

```jsx

import { Redirect } from  "react-router-dom";
 
function  SecretPage({ isLoggedIn }) {
  if (!isLoggedIn) {
    return  <Redirect  to="/login"  />;
  }
    return  <h2>Welcome to the secret page!</h2>;
}


export  default  SecretPage;

```

In this example, if the user is not logged in (`isLoggedIn` is `false`), they are redirected to the `/login` page. If they are logged in, they see the message "Welcome to the secret page!".

  

Remember, to use these components, you need to be inside a component that is wrapped with the `<BrowserRouter>` (or `<Router>`) component from `react-router-dom`. This is usually done at the top level of your application.
  

## Implementation of react-router-dom

The command to install react-router-dom as a dependency is

```bash

npm i react-router-dom

```
  

### Wrap in Browser Router


Wrap the app childs with the `<BrowserRouter/>` component, and then wrap your Route components in the Routes.

The `<Routes>` component is a container for `<Route>` components. It renders the first `<Route>` that matches the current location.


In the `<Route/>` component the `path` prop is used to define the URL path, and the `element` prop is used to define the component that should be rendered for that path.


`react-router-dom` uses inclusive matching. This means that if you have a Route with a path of `/`, it will also match `/about`, `/contact`, etc., because they all start with `/`.


Use `exact` in `<Route/>`to make sure its component it is only rendered if the URL matches exactly the `path`. [More on this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49162311/react-difference-between-route-exact-path-and-route-path)

  
The path `*` means any path. Therefore it is very important to place it last one, since `<Routes/>` will trigger the first route whose `path` matches.

 

```jsx

//Import BrowserRouter, Routes and Route from the library

import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from  "react-router-dom";
import  Home  from  "./Home";
import  Blogs  from  "./Blogs";
import  Contact  from  "./Contact";
import  NoPage  from  "./NoPage";
import  NavBar  from  "./NavBar";
  

export  default  function  App() {

  return (

//Wrap your routes in BrowserRouter component

  <BrowserRouter>
    <NavBar  />
    <Routes>
      <Route  exact  path="/"  element={<Home  />}  />
      <Route  path="/blogs"  element={<Blogs  />}  />
      <Route  path="/contact"  element={<Contact  />}  />
      <Route  path="*"  element={<NoPage  />}  />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
);

}

```

Notice that the `<NavBar/>` component is out of the `<Routes>` component, so it will be always rendered regardless of the URL visited.
  

### Set Up the Navigation Bar

This is an example of a navigation bar for the previous App using the `<Link>`component.


```jsx

import { Link } from  "react-router-dom";

function  NavBar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link  to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link  to="/blogs">Blogs</Link>
      <Link  to="/contact">Contact</Link>
    </nav>
);

}

export  default  NavBar;

```
  

## Exercise

-  [ ] Create a new react app with `create-react-app`
-  [ ] Create components: Header, Main Footer, Home, Contact, About, Product and NotFound and import them in the App component.
-  [ ] Install React Router
-  [ ] Create the following routes for your components

-  `/` renders Home component
-  `/contact` -> renders Contact component
-  `/about` -> renders About component
-  `/products/:id` -> renders Product component
- Any other url will render NotFound

-  [ ] Create a navigation bar with links to Home, Contact, About and Product
-  [ ] Header, Main and Footer are always rendered regardless of the URL visited
