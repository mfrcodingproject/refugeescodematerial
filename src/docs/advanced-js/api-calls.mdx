# API Calls

We can retrieve information that is not already present in our JavaScript program by means of making an _external call_, that is, sending a request to a remote server and then retrieving the answer from inside our program.

To make the request we need to convert the data we send into a string. Also, to understand the response, which will be a text, we need to convert it into objects in JavaScript. The process to convert the data from/to text form is called _serialization_. The format we will use is [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

When we make remote requests, the responses can take a long time to reach the client again. We don't want our program to freeze and stop responding, so the way we handle this communication is _asynchronously_. There are different ways to execute code asynchronously, but we will see only the more modern one, which is based on the [fetch method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch). This will return a special kind of object, which is called a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

### JSON

To convert some data into a JSON string, we use the `JSON.stringify` function:

```jsx
const data = ...;
const s = JSON.stringify(data);
```

Conversely, we can recover the data from its serialized form with `JSON.parse`:

```jsx
const data = JSON.parse(s);
```

### Promises

A [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) is a special kind of object, which is created with a callback function which will act on the data once it is retrieved from the server.

```jsx
var promise1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        resolve("foo");
    }, 300);
});

promise1.then(function (value) {
    console.log(value); // outputs "foo"
});

console.log(promise1); // outputs [object Promise]
```

### Old days

The original In the old days, the only way to retrieve content from a server was by means of a `XMLHttpRequest`. The way they were done looked like this:

```jsx
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();

request.open("GET", "https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films", true);
request.onload = function () {
    // Begin accessing JSON data here
    var data = JSON.parse(this.response);

    if (request.status >= 200 && request.status < 400) {
        for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) console.log(data[i].title);
    } else {
        console.log("error");
    }
};

request.send();
```

(By the way, see the funny use of `var` and `for (var i ...`? This looks indeed like old JavaScript. Nowadays we would use `const` and `data.forEach(film => console.log(film.title))` instead.)

ðŸ“– [Using Fetch](https://css-tricks.com/using-fetch/)

## **Exercise 1 | Random number**

Let's play a little with the codepen code of the previous example. Looking at the documentation of 'rand.fun', we will ask for an integer (integer).

Can we play by adding parameters to the URL of the key type = value, always after character? and separated by &, for example if you wanted to request a string with a certain length, the url would look like this

[https://api.rand.fun/text/password?length=20](https://api.rand.fun/text/password?length=20)

### **Random Dog | Complete example of a fetch request**

Display a random dog picture requesting the image to an external server.

Expected result: [Codepen Example](https://codepen.io/adalab/pen/oqQNvK?editors=1010)

Solution:

```jsx
fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
        const img = document.querySelector("img");
        img.src = data.message;
        img.alt = "Un perro";
    });
```

## **Exercise 2 | Chihuahuas, Chihuahuas everywhere**

Let's keep playing with the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/):

a) Modify the previous example so that the photos of our page only appear dogs of the Chihuahua breed.

b) Encapsulate all the logic to create a request in a function. Add a button with the text 'Show me another Chihuahua' so that when pressed, another request is made to the server of a random image and a new image of Chihuahua appears.

## **Exercise 3 | Github User**

Let's explore a new API: [the GitHub user API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/).

The URL of this API isÂ `https://api.github.com/users/{username}`, whereÂ `{username}`Â is the name of the user on GitHub. For example, here is the URL to obtain Isra user informationÂ `https://api.github.com/users/mfrcodingproject`. If you put this URL in a new browser tab you can see what data the API returns. We are going to create a page with a text input and a search button. The user will enter a GitHub username in the input. We will prepare a function that will be executed when the search button is pressed and that contains a request to the API to obtain information from that user and thus display it on our page:

-   first name
-   number of repositories
-   avatar (image)

## **Exercise 4 | Github User no Found**

Now, use the .catch for show a message when doesn't exist the user.

[Catch documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

Cacth Example:

```jsx
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/404")
    .then((res) => {
        if (res.ok) {
            return res.json();
        } else {
            throw Error(`Request rejected with status ${res.status}`);
        }
    })
    .catch(console.error);
```

## **Exercise 5 | Github Repository list**

List the repos of an organization in Github

Let's continue exploring the GitHub API by exploring the part of the API to access the information about organizations. The URL of this API isÂ `https://api.github.com/orgs/${orgname}/repos`, where {orgname} is the name of the organization on GitHub. For example, here you have the URL to obtain information from the Adalab organizationÂ `https://api.github.com/orgs/mfrcodingproject`. If you put this URL in a new browser tab you can see what data the API returns.

The objective of this exercise is to display on a website the complete list of repositories of an organization that are created in GitHub.

## **Exercise 6 | Method post**

This is a fetch with post method.

!> This api is fake. But in the real world this method save information.

When we send information with post we use body for send information by secure way. And we use the header for send information about the information how the formatÂ **'application/json'**.

```jsx
const myPost = {
    title: "A post about true facts",
    body: "Once upon a time.....",
    userId: 8888888887,
};

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(myPost),
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
})
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
        console.log("---------- we save our information -----------");
    });

fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/post/${myPost.userId}`)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
        console.log("---------- we recover our information -----------");
        console.log(data);
    });
```

## **Exercise 7 | Extra Exercise, Real Example**

Firebase is one platform where we can host static web page and little json data base and more.

Now we'll use firebase a json database for save our own information.

-   First step. We go toÂ `https://firebase.google.com`. And we create a free count. We can entry with a google count.
-   Second step. In the console we'll create a new proyect. When we ask by google analytics we click "now no".

![https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/teachers_led_material/raw/master/docs/en/assets/firebase1.jpg](https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/teachers_led_material/raw/master/docs/en/assets/firebase1.jpg)

![https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/teachers_led_material/raw/master/docs/en/assets/firebase2.jpg](https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/teachers_led_material/raw/master/docs/en/assets/firebase2.jpg)

Now we have a proyect in firebase.

![https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/teachers_led_material/raw/master/docs/en/assets/firebase3.jpg](https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/teachers_led_material/raw/master/docs/en/assets/firebase3.jpg)

-   Third step. We go to Develoment -> Database and we create a Database.

![https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/teachers_led_material/raw/master/docs/en/assets/firebase4.jpg](https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/teachers_led_material/raw/master/docs/en/assets/firebase4.jpg)

-   Fourth step. we selecte block mode. Only can read but only you can write,

![https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/teachers_led_material/raw/master/docs/en/assets/firebase5.jpg](https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/teachers_led_material/raw/master/docs/en/assets/firebase5.jpg)

-   Fifth step. Create a file with name users.json and add the next data.

```

-   Sixth step. We import the json within path /user. For this write the right path and after import the users.json file.

-   Seventh step. Now you are ready.You use fetch for access your api
