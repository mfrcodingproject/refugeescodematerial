## Introduction

Welcome back! After having learned the basics of Javascript and how it can interact with the DOM, let's start tackling some advanced features of this incredible language. In the following sections, you'll learn a bit more about **arrays**, how to interact with them, loop them or mutate them. You'll learn about **functions**, what they're for, how to use them in your advantage to make your code more reusable. You'll also have a grasp at **objects**, a really powerful way to model the data of your applications. And last but not least, you will learn about **API calls**, the easiest and fastest way to send requests to the internet to get remote data into your application. Let's start!
